// Add a good read me


// After shipping the project

// Re-Usable Component:
// there is too many tables in a lot of pages, i want to build a component where all the pages can use it, without needing to create a table in every page. that is going to be cool

// adjust the order of components in the components folder, i think it is too messy, and some things are stored in the wrong folders
