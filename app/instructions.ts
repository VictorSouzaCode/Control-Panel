// How to organize git commits and pull requests
// Ignore GitHub PRs, merge locally, then close them.
// Merge your branches one by one locally:
/* 
Now go to GitHub and:

Close the existing PRs *

Add a comment like:
“Merged locally into main and pushed. Keeping this PR closed for history.”
*/
// This keeps your repo sane and shows a clear story: you integrated everything into main.

// work in the header, the header should contain the current page i am in right after the collapsable button
// take out the search thing
// in the other side i should have user and theme toggle
// make the overview look better, because it looks good but is not that professional, make it more clean with clear separation portions in the ui

// For now organize the commits
// then Work in the orders page
